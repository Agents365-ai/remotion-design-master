# 01 - Color Theory for Video

## The 60-30-10 Rule

Apply color proportionally:
- **60%** - Dominant color (background, large areas)
- **30%** - Secondary color (supporting elements)
- **10%** - Accent color (calls-to-action, emphasis)

## Color Temperature

### Warm Colors (Red, Orange, Yellow)
- Create urgency, energy, excitement
- Draw attention, feel approachable
- Use for CTAs, highlights, warnings

### Cool Colors (Blue, Green, Purple)
- Create calm, trust, professionalism
- Recede visually, feel stable
- Use for backgrounds, large text areas

## Contrast Principles

### Value Contrast
The difference between light and dark matters more than hue for readability.

```
High contrast: Dark text on light bg (or vice versa)
Low contrast: Gray text on gray bg (avoid)
```

### Minimum Contrast Ratios (WCAG)
- Body text: 4.5:1
- Large text (≥18px or 14px bold): 3:1
- UI components: 3:1

## Color in Motion

### Avoid Rapid Color Changes
- Quick color shifts cause visual fatigue
- Transition colors over 15+ frames
- Use easing for smooth transitions

### Color as Progress Indicator
- Gray → Accent color shows progress
- Desaturated → Saturated indicates active state

## Video-Specific Considerations

### Compression Artifacts
- Gradients may show banding in compressed video
- Use subtle noise overlay to mask banding
- Avoid pure red (#ff0000) - compresses poorly

### Screen Calibration
- Test on multiple devices
- Avoid colors that look different on various screens
- Keep saturation moderate (50-70%)

## Quick Reference

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Background | Neutral (white, dark gray) or theme color |
| Primary text | High contrast to background |
| Secondary text | 50-60% opacity of primary |
| Accent | One saturated color for emphasis |
| Data (positive) | Green family |
| Data (negative) | Red family |
| Data (neutral) | Blue or orange family |
